# World Historical Volcanic Activity Explanatory Story (Tableau)

**Tableau Dashboard:** https://public.tableau.com/shared/W3QBJ8XH4?:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link

## **Project Overview**

This project explores volcanic eruption patterns across the globe, focusing on key metrics such as dominant volcano types, eruption frequencies, and associated geological characteristics. The analysis highlights global volcanic activity trends, emphasizing countries that contribute significantly to the total recorded eruptions.

## **Objectives**

- Visualize the distribution of volcanic eruptions over the last 14,000 years.
- Identify countries with the highest concentration of eruptions.
- Analyze the dominant volcano and rock types across regions.
- Provide insights into the geological processes driving volcanic activity.

## **Dataset Used**

The analysis utilized the **Holocene Volcano List** from the Smithsonian Institution's Global Volcanism Program (GVP). This dataset encompasses over 1,400 volcanoes with recorded eruptions during the Holocene epoch (approximately the last 12,000 years). It provides detailed information on each volcano, including:

- **Name and Location:** Geographical coordinates and country.
- **Volcano Type:** Classification such as stratovolcano, shield volcano, etc.
- **Eruption History:** Documented eruptions with dates and characteristics.
- **Geological Features:** Dominant rock types and tectonic settings.

This dataset is publicly accessible and serves as a vital resource for understanding global volcanic activity patterns. For more information and to access the dataset, visit the [Holocene Volcano List](https://volcano.si.edu/volcanolist_holocene.cfm).

## **Key Dashboards & Features**

1. **Country Comparison:**
- Bar charts comparing eruption counts among top volcanic nations (United States, Indonesia, Japan, Russia, Chile, Ethiopia).
- Highlighted regions accounting for nearly 50% of all eruptions.

2. **Volcano and Rock Type Analysis:**
    
    Two heatmaps classifying the factors that increase the eruption probability.
    
    - Visual representation of dominant rock types (e.g., Andesite, Basalt) in high-activity regions.
    - Volcano classification (e.g., Stratovolcanoes, Shield Volcanoes) mapped across countries.

3. **Analysis of other countries with the dominant Rock and Volcano Types:**
    - Bar charts showing the eruption count among other countries that share the same Rock Types and Volcanoes as the Dominant ones.

## **Data Insights**

- Six countries account for nearly 50% of all recorded eruptions.
- A strong correlation between tectonic plate boundaries and volcanic activity.
- Andesite and basalt dominate the rock types, while stratovolcanoes are prevalent across most regions.
